# Full Stack Open 2026

My solutions for the exercises of the [University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. This repository contains my submissions for the entire course (Parts 0–13).

Full Stack Open is an excellent introduction to modern web development. The core course consists of parts 0 to 5. After the core course, I will be completing the advanced extensions including Relational Databases and CI/CD.
